DANIEL & HIS TEAM
Our company was founded by Daniel Gonzalez.

Born and raised in Northwest Indiana and basically self employed since the age of 18, Dan has always had an interest in real estate. Having been researching real estate for years, everything from selling as an agent to investing, Dan finally dove in and picked up his first 2 properties in 2013. He loves being busy, yet also likes having his own schedule, and real estate allows him to have this flexibility.

Daniel has lived in and owned businesses in several cities throughout the region, including East Chicago, Hammond, Griffith, Hobart,Cedar Lake and Lake Station. He knows these communities in and out and has built many relationships with the community throughout the years. He is also a proud supporter of the Food Bank of Northwest Indiana.

He is a region native, born and raised. He chose to stay and reinvest in the community, while others chose to move on and never look back. He knows what its like to be put in a difficult financial situation, as his mother lost the home he grew up in to foreclosure. He pays attention to detail and is a true boots on the ground investor. When someone calls his company to sell their home, he answers, he is the one who shows up, and he helps get through the process with you.
